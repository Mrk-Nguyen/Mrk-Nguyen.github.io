title: Hello World!

I'm finally getting around to creating my blog site where I plan to write all things about data and all the things I'm learning in the vast world of Data Science.

This blog will evolve as I continue to sit down, reflect, and write about my experince working in the data field and list out the lessons I've learned in the past 15 years as a data professional.
