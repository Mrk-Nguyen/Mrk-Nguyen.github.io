I'm a data professional who has worked in the restaurant, education, and technology industries. 

I started my career as an Associate Analyst at Taco Bell Corp after graduating from UCLA. At Taco Bell, I worked my way up where I was responsible for analyzing Taco Bellâ€™s A/B market tests.

Upon graduating with my MBA in Strategy in Technology at the University of California, Irvine, I decided to switch to the education technology industry and moved to Silicon Valley to work at start-up called Udacity. At Udacity, I taught hundreds of people beginning programming, front-end development, technology entrepreneurship, and data science and data analysis.

The opportunity to build Chipotle's Data Science team in the Marketing department came up and it was too good to pass up. I'm now working at Chipotle as a Sales Analytics manager.
