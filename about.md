I'm a data professional who has worked in the restaurant, education, and technology industries. 

I started my career as an Associate Analyst at Taco Bell Corp after graduating from UCLA. At Taco Bell, I worked my way up where I was responsible for analyzing Taco Bellâ€™s A/B market tests.

Upon graduating with my MBA in Strategy and Technology at the University of California, Irvine, I switched to the education technology industry and moved to Silicon Valley to work at the start-up, Udacity. At Udacity, I taught hundreds of people programming, front-end development, technology entrepreneurship, and data science.

The opportunity to build Chipotle's Marketing Data Science team came up and it was too good to pass up. I now work at Chipotle as a Sales Analytics manager.
